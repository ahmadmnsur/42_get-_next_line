<h3><b>¤ Introduction ¤</b></h3>

<p align="center">The "get_next_line" project introduces an essential concept in C programming: static variables. The goal is to create a program that reads a specified number of characters, defined by "buffer_size," from a line of text. When a "newline character" is found, the program should move on to the next line. In addition to static variables, "get_next_line" also touches on other C programming concepts that you will uncover as you work through the project.</p>
